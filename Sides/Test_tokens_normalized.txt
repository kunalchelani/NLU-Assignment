Mr.

A

wounded

we

learned

in 
this 
part

not 
effectually

as 
it

had 
broken 
away 
from

carrying 
along

him 
half 
of

in 
the 
extraordinary 
agony 
of 
the 
wound 
, 
he

now 
dashing 
among 
the

at

Made 
UNK

afraid

else

that 
was 
why 
he 
could

any

it 
did 
n't 
seem 
possible 
that 
little 
Billy 
Mink 
could 
have 
eaten 
all

trout

Farmer 
Brown

boy 
did 
n't 
once 
think

Little 
Joe

Now 
Buster

lived 
by 
himself

Great

so 
long 
that 
this 
habit

talking

grown

did 
it 
just

keep

Of

when

down

In

British

under 
the 
corrupted 
title 
of 
UNK

this 
old 
Dutch

still 
retained

gave 
to

portions 
:

But

he 
gave 
a

First 
came 
ten 
soldiers 
carrying 
UNK 
; 
these 
were 
all 
shaped 
like 
the 
three 
gardeners 
, 
oblong 
and 
flat 
, 
with 
their 
hands 
and 
feet 
at 
the 
corners 
: 
next 
the 
ten 
courtiers 
; 
these 
were 
UNK 
all 
over 
with 
UNK 
, 
and 
walked 
two 
and 
two 
, 
as 
the 
soldiers 
did 
. 
After 
these 
came 
the 
royal 
children 
; 
there 
were 
ten 
of 
them 
, 
and 
the 
little 
dears 
came 
jumping 
merrily 
along 
hand 
in 
hand 
, 
in 
UNK 
: 
they 
were 
all 
UNK 
with 
hearts 
. 
Next 
came 
the 
guests 
, 
mostly 
Kings 
and 
UNK 
, 
and 
among 
them 
Alice 
recognised 
the 
White 
Rabbit 
: 
it 
was 
talking 
in 
a 
hurried 
nervous 
manner 
, 
smiling 
at 
everything 
that 
was 
said 
, 
and 
went 
by 
without 
noticing 
her 
. 
Then 
followed 
the 
Knave 
of 
Hearts

carrying 
the 
King

crown 
on 
a 
crimson 
velvet

and 
,

came 
THE

The

7:16 
So 
Joshua 
rose 
up 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
, 
and 
brought 
Israel 
by 
their 
tribes 
; 
and 
the 
tribe 
of 
Judah 
was 
taken 
: 
7:17 
And 
he 
brought 
the 
family 
of 
Judah 
; 
and 
he 
took 
the 
family 
of 
the 
UNK 
: 
and 
he 
brought 
the 
family 
of 
the 
UNK 
man 
by 
man 
; 
and 
UNK 
was 
taken 
: 
7:18 
And 
he 
brought 
his 
household 
man 
by 
man 
; 
and 
UNK 
, 
the 
son 
of 
UNK 
, 
the 
son 
of 
UNK 
, 
the 
son 
of 
Zerah

of 
the 
tribe 
of 
Judah

was 
taken

the

thereof 
lift 
up 
their 
voice

11:1 
And 
when 
Rehoboam 
was 
come 
to 
Jerusalem 
, 
he 
gathered 
of 
the 
house 
of 
Judah 
and 
Benjamin 
an 
hundred 
and 
fourscore 
thousand 
chosen 
men 
, 
which 
were

He 
ended 
,

his 
words 
their 
drooping 
cheer 
UNK

their

Once

the

We

that 
the

continuing

became 
stronger 
the 
third 
day

for 
,

at 
first 
only 
a 
small 
party 
had 
been 
in 
the 
secret 
, 
by 
degrees 
it 
was 
UNK 
to 
the 
whole 
school

it 
was 
necessary 
to 
secure 
secrecy

sharing 
the 
booty

with

murder

Ahab

Now 
though 
Buster 
did 
n't 
know 
it

some 
one 
had 
been 
listening 
,

that 
some 
one 
was 
none 
other 
than 
Sammy 
Jay

When 
at 
last 
Buster 
lay 
down 
for 
a 
UNK

Sammy 
flew 
away

UNK 
to 
himself

`` 
I

Old 
Pasture

The 
news 
that 
Little

Otter 
told 
at 
the 
Smiling 
Pool

how 
Farmer 
Brown 
's 
boy 
had 
run 
away 
from 
Buster 
Bear 
without 
even 
seeing 
him 
, 
-- 
soon 
spread 
all 
over 
the 
Green 
Meadows 
and 
through 
the 
Green 
Forest 
, 
until 
every 
one 
who 
lives 
there 
knew 
about 
it 
. 
Of 
course 
, 
Peter 
Rabbit 
helped 
spread 
it

Trust 
Peter 
for 
that 
! 
But 
everybody 
else 
helped 
too

You 
see

they 
had 
all 
been 
afraid 
of 
Farmer 
Brown 
's 
boy 
for 
so 
long 
that 
they 
were 
tickled 
almost 
to 
pieces 
at 
the 
very 
thought 
of 
having 
some 
one 
in 
the 
Green 
Forest 
who 
could 
make 
Farmer 
Brown 
's 
boy 
feel 
fear 
as 
they 
had 
felt 
it

so 
it

wrapped 
up

Yet 
not

it 
is 
to 
be 
doubted 
whether 
this

always 
the 
best

for 
it

The

was 
great 
of 
driving

from

he 
not 
only 
sat 
at

elbow

was 
continually 
UNK 
his 
happy 
countenance 
on 
her 
notice 
, 
and 
UNK 
addressing 
her 
upon 
every 
occasion

Instead 
of 
forgetting 
him 
, 
his 
behaviour 
was 
such 
that 
she 
could 
not 
avoid 
the 
internal 
suggestion 
of 
`` 
Can 
it 
really 
be 
as 
my 
brother 
imagined 
? 
can 
it 
be 
possible 
for 
this 
man 
to 
be 
beginning 
to 
transfer 
his 
affections 
from 
Harriet 
to 
me

UNK

insufferable 
!

Yet 
he 
would 
be 
so 
anxious 
for 
her 
being 
perfectly 
warm 
, 
would 
be 
so 
interested 
about 
her 
father 
, 
and 
so 
delighted 
with 
Mrs. 
Weston 
; 
and 
at 
last 
would 
begin 
admiring 
her 
drawings 
with 
so 
much 
zeal 
and 
so 
little 
knowledge 
as 
seemed 
terribly 
like 
a 
UNK 
lover 
, 
and 
made 
it 
some 
effort 
with 
her 
to 
preserve 
her 
good 
manners

For 
her 
own

she 
could 
not 
be 
rude

for

turn 
out 
right

was 
even 
positively 
civil

it 
was 
an 
effort 
; 
especially 
as 
something 
was 
going 
on 
amongst 
the 
others 
, 
in 
the 
most 
UNK 
period

Very 
gradually 
and 
very 
vaguely 
he 
realised 
into 
what 
rich 
roads 
the 
carriage 
was 
carrying 
him 
. 
He 
saw 
that 
they 
passed 
the 
stone 
gates 
of 
what 
might 
have 
been 
a 
park 
, 
that 
they 
began 
gradually 
to 
climb 
a 
hill 
which 
, 
while 
UNK 
on 
both 
sides 
, 
was 
somewhat 
more 
orderly 
than 
a 
forest 
. 
Then 
there 
began 
to 
grow 
upon 
him 
, 
as 
upon 
a 
man 
slowly 
waking 
from 
a 
healthy 
sleep 
, 
a 
pleasure 
in 
everything 
. 
He 
felt 
that 
the 
hedges 
were 
what 
hedges 
should 
be 
, 
living 
walls 
; 
that 
a 
hedge 
is 
like 
a 
human 
army 
, 
UNK 
, 
but 
all 
the 
more 
alive 
. 
He 
saw 
high 
UNK 
behind 
the 
hedges 
, 
and 
vaguely 
thought 
how 
happy 
boys 
would 
be 
climbing 
there 
. 
Then 
his 
carriage 
took 
a 
turn 
of 
the 
path 
, 
and 
he 
saw 
suddenly 
and 
quietly 
, 
like 
a 
long 
, 
low 
, 
sunset 
cloud 
, 
a 
long 
, 
low 
house 
, 
UNK 
in 
the 
mild 
light 
of 
sunset 
. 
All 
the 
six 
friends 
compared 
notes 
afterwards 
and 
quarrelled 
; 
but 
they 
all 
agreed 
that 
in 
some 
unaccountable 
way 
the 
place 
reminded 
them 
of 
their 
UNK 
. 
It 
was 
either 
this 
UNK 
or 
that 
crooked 
path 
, 
it 
was 
either 
this 
UNK 
of 
orchard 
or 
that 
shape 
of 
a 
window 
; 
but 
each 
man 
of 
them 
declared 
that 
he 
could 
remember 
this 
place 
before 
he 
could 
remember 
his 
mother

They 
paused 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
only 
to 
stuff 
down 
coffee 
and 
coarse 
thick 
UNK 
at 
a 
coffee 
stall 
, 
and 
then 
made 
their 
way 
across 
the 
river 
, 
which 
under 
the 
grey 
and 
growing 
light 
looked 
as 
desolate 
as 
UNK 
. 
They 
reached 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
huge 
block 
of 
buildings 
which 
they 
had 
seen 
from 
across 
the 
river 
, 
and 
began 
in 
silence 
to 
mount 
the 
naked 
and 
numberless 
stone 
steps 
, 
only 
pausing 
now 
and 
then 
to 
make 
short 
remarks 
on 
the 
rail 
of 
the 
UNK 
. 
At 
about 
every 
other 
flight 
they 
passed 
a 
window 
; 
each 
window 
showed 
them 
a 
pale 
and 
tragic 
dawn 
lifting 
itself 
UNK 
over 
London 
. 
From 
each 
the 
innumerable 
roofs 
of 
slate 
looked 
like 
the 
leaden 
UNK 
of 
a 
grey 
, 
troubled 
sea 
after 
rain 
. 
Syme 
was 
UNK 
conscious 
that 
his 
new 
adventure 
had 
somehow 
a 
quality 
of 
cold 
sanity 
worse 
than 
the 
wild 
adventures 
of 
the 
past 
. 
Last 
night 
, 
for 
instance 
, 
the 
tall 
UNK 
had 
seemed 
to 
him 
like 
a 
tower 
in 
a 
dream 
. 
As 
he 
now 
went 
up 
the 
weary 
and 
perpetual 
steps 
, 
he 
was 
UNK 
and 
bewildered 
by 
their 
almost 
infinite 
series 
. 
But 
it 
was 
not 
the 
hot 
horror 
of 
a 
dream 
or 
of 
anything 
that 
might 
be 
UNK 
or 
delusion 
. 
Their 
UNK 
was 
more 
like 
the 
empty 
UNK 
of 
arithmetic 
, 
something 
UNK 
, 
yet 
necessary 
to 
thought 
. 
Or 
it 
was 
like 
the 
UNK 
UNK 
of 
UNK 
about 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
. 
He 
was 
ascending 
the 
house 
of 
reason

a 
thing 
more 
hideous

UNK 
itself

How 
weak 
is 
thine 
heart

saith 
the 
LORD 
GOD

thine

When

the 
people 
were 
there

the 
Emperor 
asked 
the 
Nightingale 
to 
sing 
. 
Then 
the 
little 
grey 
Nightingale 
filled 
her 
throat 
full

sang

she 
sang 
so

up

tears

, 
you 
know

UNK 
do 
not 
cry 
at 
all 
easily

So 
he 
asked 
her 
to 
sing 
again

this 
time 
she 
sang 
so 
UNK 
that 
the 
tears 
came 
out 
of 
his 
eyes

ran 
down 
his 
cheeks

was 
a 
great 
success

They 
asked 
the 
little 
Nightingale 
to 
sing 
, 
over 
and 
over 
again 
, 
and 
when 
they 
had 
listened 
enough 
the 
Emperor 
said 
that 
she 
should 
be 
made 
`` 
UNK

Chief

the 
Court

She 
was 
to

a 
golden 
perch

bed

a 
little 
golden 
cage

was 
to 
be 
allowed 
to 
go 
out 
twice 
every 
day

But 
there 
were 
twelve 
servants 
appointed

wait 
on 
her

went 
out

twelve

hold

likewise 
also 
the 
men

leaving 
the 
natural 
use

burned 
in

no

man 
who 
sits 
in 
darkness 
, 
and 
who 
chose 
us 
all 
, 
chose 
me 
because 
I 
had 
all 
the 
crazy 
look 
of 
a 
UNK 
-- 
because 
my 
smile 
went 
crooked 
, 
and 
my 
eyes 
were 
gloomy 
, 
even 
when 
I 
smiled 
. 
But 
there 
must 
have 
been 
something 
in 
me 
that 
answered 
to 
the 
nerves 
in 
all 
these 
UNK 
men 
. 
For 
when 
I 
first 
saw 
Sunday 
he 
expressed 
to 
me 
, 
not 
your 
airy 
vitality 
, 
but 
something 
both 
gross 
and 
sad 
in 
the 
Nature 
of 
Things 
. 
I 
found 
him 
smoking 
in 
a 
twilight 
room 
, 
a 
room 
with 
brown 
blind 
down 
, 
infinitely 
more 
UNK 
than 
the 
genial 
darkness 
in 
which 
our 
master 
lives 
. 
He 
sat 
there 
on 
a 
bench 
, 
a 
huge 
heap 
of 
a 
man 
, 
dark 
and 
out 
of 
shape 
. 
He 
listened 
to 
all 
my 
words 
without 
speaking 
or 
even 
stirring 
. 
I 
poured 
out 
my 
most 
passionate 
UNK 
, 
and 
asked 
my 
most 
eloquent 
questions 
. 
Then 
, 
after 
a 
long 
silence 
, 
the 
UNK 
began 
to 
shake 
, 
and 
I 
thought 
it 
was 
shaken 
by 
some 
secret 
malady 
. 
It 
shook 
like 
a 
loathsome 
and 
living 
UNK 
. 
It 
reminded 
me 
of 
everything 
I 
had 
ever 
read 
about 
the 
base 
bodies 
that 
are 
the 
origin 
of 
life 
-- 
the 
deep 
sea 
UNK 
and 
UNK 
. 
It 
seemed 
like 
the 
final 
form 
of 
matter 
, 
the 
most 
shapeless 
and 
the 
most 
shameful 
. 
I 
could 
only 
tell 
myself 
, 
from 
its 
UNK 
, 
that 
it 
was 
something 
at 
least 
that 
such 
a 
monster 
could 
be 
miserable 
. 
And 
then 
it 
broke 
upon 
me 
that 
the 
UNK 
mountain 
was 
shaking 
with 
a 
lonely 
laughter 
, 
and 
the 
laughter 
was 
at 
me 
. 
Do 
you 
ask 
me 
to 
forgive 
him 
that 
? 
It 
is 
no 
small 
thing 
to 
be 
laughed 
at 
by 
something 
at 
once 
lower 
and 
stronger 
than 
UNK 
.

As 
I 
UNK 
to 
the 
shores 
I 
know 
not 
, 
As 
I 
list 
to 
the 
UNK 
, 
the 
voices 
of 
men 
and 
women 
wreck 
'd 
, 
As 
I 
UNK 
the 
impalpable 
breezes 
that 
set 
in 
upon 
me 
, 
As 
the 
ocean 
so 
mysterious 
rolls 
toward 
me 
closer 
and 
closer 
, 
I 
too 
but 
signify 
at 
the 
utmost 
a 
little 
UNK 
drift

A 
few 
sands

dead 
leaves

The 
large 
importance 
attached 
to 
the 
harpooneer 
's 
vocation 
is 
evinced 
by 
the 
fact 
, 
that 
originally 
in 
the 
old 
Dutch 
Fishery 
, 
two 
centuries 
and 
more 
ago 
, 
the 
command 
of 
a 
whale 
ship 
was 
not 
wholly 
lodged 
in 
the 
person 
now 
called 
the 
captain 
,

was 
divided 
between 
him 
and 
an 
officer 
called 
the 
UNK

about

generally 
go 
in

nearly

UNK

spreads

He 
sits 
down 
with 
his

waters 
the

tears

asking 
for

at

with 
a 
smile

final 
satisfaction

Mrs. 
Dashwood

whose 
terror 
as 
they 
drew 
near 
the 
house 
had 
produced 
almost 
the 
conviction 
of 
Marianne

being 
no 
more 
, 
had 
no 
voice 
to 
inquire 
after 
her

no 
voice 
even 
for 
Elinor

but 
SHE 
, 
waiting 
neither 
for 
salutation 
nor 
inquiry

instantly 
gave 
the 
joyful 
relief 
;

her 
mother

catching 
it 
with 
all 
her 
usual 
warmth

in

happiness

fears

minute

two 
she 
stood 
looking 
at

wondering 
what 
to 
do 
next

when 
suddenly 
a 
footman 
in 
livery 
came 
running 
out 
of 
the 
wood

( 
she 
considered 
him 
to 
be 
a 
footman 
because 
he 
was 
in 
livery

otherwise

judging 
by 
his 
face 
only

she 
would 
have 
called 
him

and 
UNK 
loudly 
at 
the 
door 
with 
his 
UNK

It 
was 
opened 
by 
another 
footman 
in 
livery 
, 
with 
a 
round 
face 
, 
and 
large 
eyes 
like 
a 
UNK 
; 
and 
both 
footmen 
, 
Alice 
noticed 
, 
had 
UNK 
hair 
that 
curled 
all 
over 
their 
heads

She 
felt 
very 
curious 
to 
know 
what 
it 
was 
all 
about 
, 
and 
crept 
a 
little 
way 
out 
of 
the 
wood 
to 
listen

He 
approached 
,

addressing 
himself 
rather 
to 
Elinor

Marianne 
, 
as 
if 
wishing 
to 
avoid 
her 
eye 
, 
and 
determined 
not 
to 
observe 
her 
attitude

inquired 
in 
a 
hurried 
manner 
after 
Mrs.

and 
asked 
how 
long 
they 
had 
been 
in 
town

Elinor 
was 
robbed 
of 
all 
presence

mind

address

He 
and 
Bull 
sprang 
into 
the 
cab 
together 
, 
the 
Professor 
and 
the 
Inspector 
into 
another 
, 
while 
the 
Secretary 
and 
the 
late 
Gogol 
scrambled 
into 
a 
third 
just 
in 
time 
to 
pursue 
the 
flying 
Syme 
, 
who 
was 
pursuing 
the 
flying 
President 
. 
Sunday 
led 
them 
a 
wild 
chase 
towards 
the 
UNK 
, 
his 
cabman 
, 
evidently 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
more 
than 
common 
UNK 
, 
urging 
the 
horse 
at 
UNK 
speed 
. 
But 
Syme 
was 
in 
no 
mood 
for 
delicacies 
, 
and 
he 
stood 
up 
in 
his 
own 
cab 
shouting 
, 
`` 
Stop 
thief 
! 
'' 
until 
crowds 
ran 
along 
beside 
his 
cab 
, 
and 
policemen 
began 
to 
stop 
and 
ask 
questions 
. 
All 
this 
had 
its 
influence 
upon 
the 
President 
's 
cabman 
, 
who 
began 
to 
look 
dubious 
, 
and 
to 
slow 
down 
to 
a 
UNK 
. 
He 
opened 
the 
trap 
to 
talk 
reasonably 
to 
his 
fare 
, 
and 
in 
so 
doing 
let 
the 
long 
whip 
droop 
over 
the 
front 
of 
the 
cab 
. 
Sunday 
leant 
forward 
, 
seized 
it 
, 
and 
jerked 
it 
violently 
out 
of 
the 
man 
's 
hand 
. 
Then 
standing 
up 
in 
front 
of 
the 
cab 
himself 
, 
he 
lashed 
the 
horse 
and 
roared 
aloud 
, 
so 
that 
they 
went 
down 
the 
streets 
like 
a 
flying 
storm 
. 
Through 
street 
after 
street 
and 
square 
after 
square 
went 
whirling 
this 
preposterous 
vehicle 
, 
in 
which 
the 
fare 
was 
urging 
the 
horse 
and 
the 
driver 
trying 
desperately 
to 
stop 
it 
. 
The 
other 
three 
UNK 
came 
after 
it 
( 
if 
the 
phrase 
be 
UNK 
of 
a 
cab 
) 
like 
panting 
UNK

Margery

not

she 
loved 
them 
dearly

whenever 
it 
was

used

go

look

lovely

always 
to

always

A 
few 
doubted 
Little 
Joe 
's 
story

One 
of 
them 
was 
Blacky 
the 
Crow 
. 
Another 
was 
Reddy 
Fox 
. 
Blacky 
doubted 
because 
he 
knew 
Farmer 
Brown 
's 
boy 
so 
well 
that 
he 
could 
n't 
imagine 
him 
afraid

Reddy 
doubted 
because 
he 
did 
n't 
want 
to 
believe 
. 
You 
see 
, 
he 
was 
jealous 
of 
Buster 
Bear 
, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
was 
afraid 
of 
him

So 
Reddy 
pretended 
not 
to 
believe 
a 
word 
of 
what 
Little 
Joe 
Otter 
had 
said 
, 
and 
he 
agreed 
with 
Blacky 
that 
only 
by 
seeing 
Farmer 
Brown 
's 
boy 
afraid 
could 
he 
ever 
be 
made 
to 
believe 
it 
. 
But 
nearly 
everybody 
else 
believed 
it 
, 
and 
there 
was 
great 
rejoicing 
. 
Most 
of 
them 
were 
afraid 
of 
Buster 
, 
very 
much 
afraid 
of 
him 
, 
because 
he 
was 
so 
big 
and 
strong 
. 
But 
they 
were 
still 
more 
afraid 
of 
Farmer 
Brown 
's 
boy 
, 
because 
they 
did 
n't 
know 
him 
or 
understand 
him 
, 
and 
because 
in 
the 
past 
he 
had 
tried 
to 
catch 
some 
of 
them 
in 
UNK 
and 
had 
hunted 
some 
of 
them

his 
terrible

Once 
a 
little 
mouse 
who 
lived 
in 
the 
country 
invited 
a 
little 
mouse 
from 
the 
city 
to 
visit 
him

When 
the 
little 
City 
Mouse 
sat 
down 
to 
dinner 
he 
was 
surprised 
to 
find 
that 
the 
Country 
Mouse 
had 
nothing 
to 
eat 
except 
barley 
and 
grain

Right 
Whale

mouth 
, 
look 
around 
you

And 
he 
went 
forward 
a 
little 
, 
and 
fell 
on 
the 
ground 
, 
and 
prayed 
that 
, 
if 
it 
were

hour 
might

The

Poor 
Mr.

trembled 
as 
he 
sat

and 
, 
as 
Emma 
had 
foreseen

would 
scarcely 
be 
satisfied 
without 
their 
promising 
never 
to 
go 
beyond

stand

his

UNK 
UNK 
his 
general 
sanity

carried 
it 
,

turned 
all 
its 
UNK 
cannon 
upon 
its 
own 
mad 
mark

so 
that 
far 
from 
having 
lost 
his 
strength 
, 
Ahab 
, 
to 
that 
one 
end 
, 
did 
now 
possess 
a 
thousand 
fold 
more 
UNK 
than 
ever

had 
UNK 
brought 
to 
bear 
upon 
any

Yet 
one 
doubt 
UNK 
me 
still 
, 
lest 
all 
I 
can 
not 
die

Lest 
that 
pure 
breath 
of 
life

the 
spirit 
of 
Man 
Which 
God 
inspired 
, 
can 
not 
together 
perish 
With 
this 
corporeal 
UNK 
; 
then 
, 
in 
the 
grave 
, 
Or 
in 
some 
other 
dismal 
place 
, 
who 
knows 
But 
I 
shall 
die 
a 
living 
death

Sir 
Walter

, 
in 
UNK

was 
a 
man 
who 
, 
for 
his 
own 
amusement 
, 
never 
took 
up 
any 
book

the 
UNK 
; 
there 
he 
found 
occupation 
for 
an 
idle 
hour 
, 
and 
consolation 
in 
a 
distressed 
one 
; 
there 
his 
UNK 
were 
roused 
into 
admiration 
and 
respect 
, 
by 
contemplating 
the 
UNK 
remnant 
of 
the 
earliest 
UNK 
; 
there 
any 
unwelcome 
sensations 
, 
arising 
from 
domestic 
affairs 
changed 
naturally 
into 
pity 
and 
contempt 
as 
he 
turned 
over 
the 
almost 
endless 
UNK 
of 
the 
last 
century 
; 
and 
there 
, 
if 
every 
other 
leaf 
were 
UNK 
, 
he 
could 
read 
his 
own 
history 
with 
an 
interest 
which 
never 
failed

And 
he 
said

Thus 
saith 
the

, 
Make 
this 
valley 
full 
of 
UNK 
~~ 
~~ 
~ 
~ 
He 
was 
typical 
of 
each 
of 
the 
tribe 
; 
each 
man 
was 
UNK 
and 
differently 
wrong 
. 
Next 
to 
him 
sat 
Tuesday 
, 
the 
UNK 
Gogol 
, 
a 
man 
more 
obviously 
mad 
. 
Next 
was 
Wednesday 
, 
a 
certain 
Marquis 
de 
St. 
Eustache 
, 
a 
sufficiently 
characteristic 
figure 
. 
The 
first 
few 
glances 
found 
nothing 
unusual 
about 
him 
, 
except 
that 
he 
was 
the 
only 
man 
at 
table 
who 
wore 
the 
fashionable 
clothes 
as 
if 
they 
were 
really 
his 
own 
. 
He 
had 
a 
black 
French 
beard 
cut 
square 
and 
a 
black 
English 
frock-coat 
cut 
even 
UNK 
. 
But 
Syme 
, 
sensitive 
to 
such 
things 
, 
felt 
somehow 
that 
the 
man 
carried 
a 
rich 
atmosphere 
with 
him 
, 
a 
rich 
atmosphere 
that 
UNK 
. 
It 
reminded 
one 
UNK 
of 
drowsy 
odours 
and 
of 
dying 
lamps 
in 
the 
darker 
poems 
of 
Byron 
and 
UNK 
. 
With 
this 
went 
a 
sense 
of 
his 
being 
clad 
, 
not 
in 
lighter 
colours 
, 
but 
in 
UNK 
materials 
; 
his 
black 
seemed 
richer 
and 
warmer 
than 
the 
black 
shades 
about 
him 
, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
UNK 
of 
profound 
colour 
. 
His 
black 
coat 
looked 
as 
if 
it 
were 
only 
black 
by 
being 
too 
dense 
a 
purple 
. 
His 
black 
beard 
looked 
as 
if 
it 
were 
only 
black 
by 
being 
too 
deep 
a 
blue 
. 
And 
in 
the 
gloom 
and 
thickness 
of 
the 
beard 
his 
dark 
red 
mouth 
showed 
UNK 
and 
scornful 
. 
Whatever 
he 
was 
he 
was 
not 
a 
Frenchman 
; 
he 
might 
be 
a 
Jew 
; 
he 
might 
be 
something 
deeper 
yet 
in 
the 
dark 
heart 
of 
the 
East 
. 
In 
the 
bright 
coloured 
Persian 
tiles 
and 
pictures 
showing 
UNK 
hunting 
, 
you 
may 
see 
just 
those 
almond 
eyes 
, 
those 
UNK 
beards 
, 
those 
cruel 
, 
crimson 
lips

`` 
You 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
democratic

'' 
answered 
the 
policeman 
, 
`` 
but 
you 
were 
right 
when 
you 
said 
just 
now 
that 
our 
ordinary 
treatment 
of 
the 
poor 
criminal 
was 
a 
pretty 
brutal 
business 
. 
I 
tell 
you 
I 
am 
sometimes 
sick 
of 
my 
trade 
when 
I 
see 
how 
perpetually 
it 
means 
merely 
a 
war 
upon 
the 
ignorant 
and 
the 
desperate 
. 
But 
this 
new 
movement 
of 
ours 
is 
a 
very 
different 
affair 
. 
We 
deny 
the 
UNK 
English 
UNK 
that 
the 
UNK 
are 
the 
dangerous 
criminals 
. 
We 
remember 
the 
Roman 
UNK 
. 
We 
remember 
the 
great 
UNK 
princes 
of 
the 
UNK 
. 
We 
say 
that 
the 
dangerous 
criminal 
is 
the 
educated 
criminal

We 
say 
that 
the 
most 
dangerous 
criminal 
now 
is 
the 
entirely 
UNK 
modern 
philosopher

UNK 
to 
him 
, 
UNK 
and 
UNK 
are 
essentially 
moral 
men 
; 
my 
heart 
goes 
out 
to 
them 
. 
They 
accept 
the 
essential 
ideal 
of 
man 
; 
they 
merely 
seek 
it 
UNK 
. 
Thieves 
respect 
property 
. 
They 
merely 
wish 
the 
property 
to 
become 
their 
property 
that 
they 
may 
more 
perfectly 
respect 
it 
. 
But 
philosophers 
dislike 
property 
as 
property 
; 
they 
wish 
to 
destroy 
the 
very 
idea 
of 
personal 
possession 
. 
UNK 
respect 
marriage 
, 
or 
they 
would 
not 
go 
through 
the 
highly 
UNK 
and 
even 
UNK 
UNK 
of 
UNK 
. 
But 
philosophers 
despise 
marriage 
as 
marriage 
. 
UNK 
respect 
human 
life 
; 
they 
merely 
wish 
to 
attain 
a 
greater 
fulness 
of 
human 
life 
in 
themselves 
by 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
what 
seems 
to 
them 
to 
be 
lesser 
lives 
. 
But 
philosophers 
hate 
life 
itself 
, 
their 
own 
as 
much 
as 
other 
people 
's

the

could 
make 
out 
from

that 
, 
as 
far 
as 
Enscombe 
was 
concerned 
, 
there 
was 
very 
little 
going 
on

that 
their 
UNK 
were 
among 
a 
range 
of 
great 
families

none 
very 
near

that 
even

an

that

it 
was 
not

without 
considerable

Before

Emma

It

at

again

Now 
on

was 
the 
silver 
and 
the 
gold 
and 
the 
vessels 
weighed 
in

also 
unto

was 
a 
certain

man 
,

had 
a

came 
out

New

UNK 
for 
the 
UNK 
of 
the 
great 
conspiracy

UNK 
under 
the 
advice 
of 
his 
friend 
the 
policeman 
( 
who 
was 
UNK 
inclined 
to 
UNK 
) 
, 
he 
trimmed 
his 
hair 
and 
beard 
, 
bought 
a 
good 
hat 
, 
clad 
himself 
in 
an 
exquisite 
summer 
suit 
of 
light 
UNK 
, 
with 
a 
pale 
yellow 
flower 
in 
the 
UNK 
, 
and 
, 
in 
short 
, 
became 
that 
elegant 
and 
rather 
UNK 
person 
whom 
Gregory 
had 
first 
encountered 
in 
the 
little 
garden 
of 
Saffron 
Park 
. 
Before 
he 
finally 
left 
the 
police 
UNK 
his 
friend 
provided 
him 
with 
a 
small 
blue 
card 
, 
on 
which 
was 
written 
, 
`` 
The 
Last 
UNK

'' 
and 
a 
number 
, 
the 
sign 
of 
his 
official 
authority

He 
put 
this 
carefully 
in 
his 
upper 
waistcoat 
pocket 
, 
lit 
a 
cigarette 
,

went 
forth 
to 
track

fight

enemy

all

UNK

already

one

up

silent 
Thames

set 
down

had 
a

would 
have 
killed 
him

she 
could 
not

Herod

So 
that 
thousands 
of 
poor 
English 
people 
trembled 
before 
a 
mysterious 
UNK 
with 
an 
ancient 
destiny

was 
a 
UNK 
and 
a 
UNK 
not 
twelve 
years 
ago

I 
think 
it 
very 
typical 
of 
the 
real 
case 
against 
our 
aristocracy

it

from

the

we

about

a 
glimpse 
through

trees 
told 
him 
all 
he 
wanted 
to 
know 
and 
he 
laughed

Through 
a 
gap

appeared 
for 
a 
moment 
one 
of 
those 
old 
wooden 
houses

faced 
with 
black 
beams

which 
are 
still

here

which 
most

see 
imitated 
in 
some 
show 
called

``

It 
was 
in 
view 
only 
long 
enough

see 
that

pondered 
some 
time

this

Father

enjoyed 
such

Little

put

This

off 
it

At

was 
almost 
ready

up

he

The

all 
his

crossed

the

soon 
UNK 
their

it

conveying

upon 
being

he 
will 
frequently

And 
David

the

as 
to 
give 
something 
of 
the 
UNK 
and 
the 
UNK 
of 
a 
small 
orchard 
. 
At 
one 
of

a 
very 
UNK 
little 
priest 
sat 
in 
complete

UNK

nineteen 
would 
naturally 
blind 
him

her 
beauty

good 
nature

the 
four 
succeeding 
years

years 
, 
which 
if 
rationally 
spent 
, 
give 
such 
improvement 
to 
the 
understanding 
, 
must 
have 
opened 
his 
eyes 
to 
her 
UNK 
of 
education 
, 
while 
the

period 
of 
time 
, 
spent 
on 
her 
side 
in 
inferior 
society 
and 
more 
UNK 
pursuits 
, 
had 
perhaps 
robbed 
her 
of 
that 
simplicity 
which 
might 
once 
have 
given 
an 
interesting 
character

her 
beauty

was 
once 
a

famous 
artist 
who 
lived 
in 
the 
little

UNK

He 
did 
such 
fine 
work

the 
UNK

UNK

ordered 
a 
portrait 
statue 
of 
himself 
, 
on 
horseback 
, 
to 
be 
done 
in 
bronze 
. 
The 
artist 
was 
UNK 
at 
the 
commission 
, 
and 
worked 
early 
and 
late 
at 
the 
statue

And 
he 
arose 
from 
thence 
,

cometh 
into 
the 
coasts 
of 
Judaea 
by 
the 
farther 
side 
of 
Jordan

the 
people 
resort 
unto 
him 
again

`` 
UNK 
, 
'' 
he 
began 
, 
as 
sharp 
as 
a 
UNK 
, 
`` 
our 
meeting 
tonight 
is 
important 
, 
though 
it 
need 
not 
be 
long 
. 
This 
branch 
has 
always 
had 
the 
honour 
of 
UNK 
UNK 
for 
the 
UNK 
European 
Council 
. 
We 
have 
elected 
many 
and 
splendid 
UNK 
. 
We 
all 
lament 
the 
sad 
decease 
of 
the 
heroic 
UNK 
who 
occupied 
the 
post 
until 
last 
week 
. 
As 
you 
know 
, 
his 
services 
to 
the 
cause 
were 
considerable 
. 
He 
UNK 
the 
great 
dynamite 
UNK 
of 
UNK 
which 
, 
under 
happier 
circumstances 
, 
ought 
to 
have 
killed 
everybody 
on 
the 
UNK 
. 
As 
you 
also 
know 
, 
his 
death 
was 
as 
UNK 
as 
his 
life 
, 
for 
he 
died 
through 
his 
faith 
in 
a 
UNK 
mixture 
of 
UNK 
and 
water 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
milk 
, 
which 
UNK 
he 
regarded 
as 
barbaric 
, 
and 
as 
UNK 
cruelty 
to 
the 
cow 
. 
UNK 
, 
or 
anything 
approaching 
to 
cruelty 
, 
revolted 
him 
always 
. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
to 
UNK 
his 
virtues 
that 
we 
are 
met 
, 
but 
for 
a 
harder 
task 
. 
It 
is 
difficult 
properly 
to 
praise 
his 
qualities 
, 
but 
it 
is 
more 
difficult 
to 
UNK 
them 
. 
Upon 
you 
, 
comrades 
, 
it 
UNK 
this 
evening 
to 
choose 
out 
of 
the 
company 
present 
the 
man 
who 
shall 
be 
Thursday 
. 
If 
any 
comrade 
UNK 
a 
name 
I 
will 
put 
it 
to 
the 
vote 
. 
If 
no 
comrade 
UNK 
a 
name 
, 
I 
can 
only 
tell 
myself 
that 
that 
dear 
dynamiter 
, 
who 
is 
gone 
from 
us 
, 
has 
carried 
into 
the 
UNK 
UNK 
the 
last 
secret 
of 
his 
virtue 
and 
his 
innocence 
.

Nothing 
could 
have 
done 
it 
away 
to 
my 
feelings

~~

UNK 
And 
he 
took 
the 
people 
, 
and 
divided 
them 
into 
three 
companies 
, 
and 
laid 
wait 
in 
the 
field 
, 
and 
looked 
, 
and 
, 
behold 
, 
the 
people 
were 
come 
forth 
out 
of 
the 
city 
; 
and 
he 
rose 
up 
against 
them 
, 
and 
smote 
them

Then 
said 
I 
in 
my 
heart 
, 
As 
it 
UNK 
to 
the 
fool 
, 
so 
it 
UNK 
even 
to 
me 
; 
and 
why 
was 
I 
then 
more 
wise 
? 
Then 
I 
said 
in 
my 
heart 
, 
that 
this 
also 
is 
vanity

UNK

by

turn 
out

After 
they 
had 
been 
assembled 
about 
an 
hour 
, 
Mr. 
Palmer 
UNK 
towards 
the 
Miss 
Dashwoods 
to 
express 
his 
surprise 
on 
seeing 
them 
in 
town 
, 
though 
Colonel 
Brandon 
had 
been 
first 
informed 
of 
their 
arrival 
at 
his 
house 
, 
and 
he 
had 
himself 
said 
something 
very 
droll 
on 
hearing 
that 
they 
were 
to 
come

Lady

I 
~~

~~ 
~~ 
~

It 
seemed 
no 
bad 
idea 
; 
but 
upon 
second 
thoughts 
I 
dismissed 
it 
~~ 
~~ 
~ 
~ 
His 
complexion 
was 
white 
with 
agitation 
, 
and 
he 
looked 
as 
if 
fearful 
of 
his 
reception 
, 
and 
conscious 
that 
he 
merited 
no 
kind 
one 
. 
Mrs. 
Dashwood 
, 
however 
, 
UNK 
, 
as 
she 
trusted 
, 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
that 
daughter 
, 
by 
whom 
she 
then 
meant 
in 
the 
warmth 
of 
her 
heart 
to 
be 
guided 
in 
every 
thing 
, 
met 
with 
a 
look 
of 
forced 
complacency 
, 
gave 
him 
her 
hand 
, 
and 
wished 
him 
joy

10:9 
O 
Israel 
, 
thou 
hast 
sinned 
from 
the 
days 
of 
Gibeah 
: 
there 
they 
stood 
: 
the 
battle 
in 
Gibeah 
against 
the 
children 
of 
iniquity 
did 
not 
overtake 
them

~~

Wherefore 
he 
had 
no 
fancy 
for 
lowering 
for 
whales 
after 
UNK 
; 
nor 
for 
persisting 
in 
fighting 
a 
fish 
that 
too 
much 
persisted 
in 
fighting 
him

But 
it 
came 
to 
pass 
, 
that 
when 
Sanballat 
heard 
that 
we 
builded 
the 
wall

he 
was 
wroth

took 
great 
indignation

mocked

is 
full 
of 
silver

neither 
is 
there

was 
heard 
to 
whistle

UNK

conclusion

None 
can 
be 
ignorant 
that 
near 
Naples

the 
celebrated

mountain

that 
, 
from

happen 
violent

immense 
clouds

issue 
from 
different 
UNK

UNK

as 
they 
are 
called 
, 
but 
more 
especially 
from 
the 
summit 
of 
the 
mountain 
, 
which 
is 
distinguished 
by 
the 
name 
of

what 
would 
it 
amount 
to 
?

I

would

now

brightened 
up

was 
now 
the 
right 
size 
for 
going 
through 
the 
little 
door 
into 
that 
lovely 
garden

First 
, 
however 
, 
she 
waited 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
to 
see 
if 
she 
was 
going 
to 
shrink 
any 
further

felt

tried 
to 
fancy 
what

flame 
of 
a 
candle 
is 
like 
after 
the 
candle 
is 
blown 
out

could 
not 
remember 
ever 
having 
seen 
such 
a 
thing

UNK 
more

so 
UNK 
UNK

that 
whaling 
may 
well

up

smart

You 
know 
he 
had 
guessed 
the 
day 
before 
who 
had 
spoiled 
his 
fishing 
. 
So 
this 
morning 
he 
only 
went 
far 
enough 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
if 
Little 
Joe 
were 
watching

him 
, 
as 
he 
was 
sure 
he 
would 
be 
, 
he 
would 
see 
him 
coming 
. 
Then 
, 
instead 
of 
keeping 
on 
to 
the 
little 
pool 
, 
he 
hurried 
to 
a 
place 
way 
down 
the 
Laughing 
Brook 
, 
where 
the 
water 
was 
very 
shallow 
, 
hardly 
over 
his 
feet 
, 
and 
there 
he 
sat 
UNK

himself

Things 
happened 
just

had 
expected

The 
frightened 
fish

Joe 
chased 
out 
of

little 
pools 
up 
above 
swam 
down 
the 
Laughing 
Brook

because 
, 
you 
know

Little 
Joe 
was 
behind 
them 
, 
and 
there 
was 
nowhere 
else 
for 
them 
to 
go 
. 
When 
they 
came 
to 
the 
place 
where 
Buster 
was 
waiting 
, 
all 
he 
had 
to 
do 
was 
to 
UNK 
them 
out 
on 
to 
the 
bank 
. 
It 
was 
great 
fun 
. 
It 
did 
n't 
take 
Buster 
long 
to 
catch 
all 
the 
fish 
he 
could 
eat 
. 
Then

saved

him

still 
with

queer

simplicity

stranger 
in 
a 
UNK 
for 
some 
trouble

passing

practically 
thanking

For 
one 
moment 
the 
heaven 
of 
Syme 
again 
grew 
black 
with 
supernatural 
terrors 
. 
Surely 
the 
man 
had 
a 
charmed 
life 
. 
But 
this 
new 
spiritual 
dread 
was 
a 
more 
awful 
thing 
than 
had 
been 
the 
mere 
spiritual 
UNK 
UNK 
by 
the 
paralytic 
who 
pursued 
him 
. 
The 
Professor 
was 
only 
a 
UNK 
; 
this 
man 
was 
a 
devil 
-- 
perhaps 
he 
was 
the 
Devil 
! 
Anyhow 
, 
this 
was 
certain 
, 
that 
three 
times 
had 
a 
human 
sword 
been 
driven 
into 
him 
and 
made 
no 
mark 
. 
When 
Syme 
had 
that 
thought 
he 
drew 
himself 
up 
, 
and 
all 
that 
was 
good 
in 
him 
sang 
high 
up 
in 
the 
air 
as 
a 
high 
wind 
sings 
in 
the 
trees 
. 
He 
thought 
of 
all 
the 
human 
things 
in 
his 
story 
-- 
of 
the 
Chinese 
lanterns 
in 
Saffron 
Park 
, 
of 
the 
girl 
's 
red 
hair 
in 
the 
garden 
, 
of 
the 
honest 
, 
UNK 
sailors 
down 
by 
the 
UNK 
, 
of 
his 
UNK 
companions 
standing 
by 
. 
Perhaps 
he 
had 
been 
chosen 
as 
a 
champion 
of 
all 
these 
fresh 
and 
kindly 
things 
to 
cross 
swords 
with 
the 
enemy 
of 
all 
creation 
. 
`` 
After 
all 
, 
'' 
he 
said 
to 
himself 
, 
`` 
I 
am 
more 
than 
a 
devil 
; 
I 
am 
a 
man 
. 
I 
can 
do 
the 
one 
thing 
which 
Satan 
himself 
can 
not 
do 
-- 
I 
can 
die 
, 
'' 
and 
as 
the 
word 
went 
through 
his 
head 
, 
he 
heard 
a 
faint 
and 
far-off 
UNK 
, 
which 
would 
soon 
be 
the 
roar 
of 
the 
Paris 
train

Francisco

was 
one

those 
who 
endeavoured 
to 
UNK 
THE 
UNK

and 
all 
that 
he 
said 
upon 
the 
subject 
was 
, 
that 
he 
would 
not 
exchange 
Francisco

Verily 
I 
say 
unto 
you

There 
be 
some 
standing 
here 
, 
which 
shall 
not 
taste 
of 
death 
, 
till 
they 
see 
the 
Son 
of 
man 
coming 
in 
his 
kingdom 
~~ 
~~ 
~

He 
was 
spinning 
out 
his 
sentences 
, 
making 
them 
UNK 
long 
and 
lingering 
, 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
maddening 
the 
practical 
little 
Doctor 
into 
an 
explosion 
of 
impatience 
which 
might 
show 
his 
hand 
. 
But 
the 
little 
Doctor 
continued 
only 
to 
stare 
and 
smile 
, 
and 
the 
UNK 
was 
UNK 
work 
. 
Syme 
began 
to 
feel 
a 
new 
sickness 
and 
despair 
. 
The 
Doctor 
's 
smile 
and 
silence 
were 
not 
at 
all 
like 
the 
UNK 
stare 
and 
horrible 
silence 
which 
he 
had 
confronted 
in 
the 
Professor 
half 
an 
hour 
before 
. 
About 
the 
Professor 
's 
UNK 
and 
all 
his 
UNK 
there 
was 
always 
something 
merely 
grotesque 
, 
like 
a 
UNK 
. 
Syme 
remembered 
those 
wild 
woes 
of 
yesterday 
as 
one 
UNK 
being 
afraid 
of 
UNK 
in 
childhood 
. 
But 
here 
was 
daylight 
; 
here 
was 
a 
healthy 
, 
UNK 
man 
in 
UNK 
, 
not 
odd 
save 
for 
the 
accident 
of 
his 
ugly 
spectacles 
, 
not 
glaring 
or 
grinning 
at 
all 
, 
but 
smiling 
steadily 
and 
not 
saying 
a 
word 
. 
The 
whole 
had 
a 
sense 
of 
UNK 
reality 
. 
Under 
the 
increasing 
sunlight 
the 
colours 
of 
the 
Doctor 
's 
complexion 
, 
the 
pattern 
of 
his 
UNK 
, 
grew 
and 
expanded 
UNK 
, 
as 
such 
things 
grow 
too 
important 
in 
a 
UNK 
UNK 
. 
But 
his 
smile 
was 
quite 
slight 
, 
the 
UNK 
of 
his 
head 
polite 
; 
the 
only 
UNK 
thing 
was 
his 
silence

standing 
at

with 
face 
turned 
from

did 
not 
immediately 
say 
any 
thing 
; 
and 
when 
she 
did 
speak 
, 
it 
was 
in 
a 
voice 
nearly 
as 
agitated 
as

The

did 
tear

her

He 
also 
against

was 
bold 
: 
A 
leper 
once 
he 
lost 
,

gained 
a 
king

Ahaz

his 
UNK 
UNK 
, 
whom 
he 
drew 
God

altar 
to 
UNK

UNK 
For 
one 
of 
Syrian 
mode 
, 
whereon 
to 
burn 
His 
odious 
offerings 
, 
and 
adore 
the 
gods 
Whom 
he 
had 
vanquished

There 
was 
something 
in 
this 
silent 
and 
unexpected 
innocence 
that 
left 
Syme 
in 
a 
final 
fury 
. 
The 
man 
's 
colourless 
face 
and 
manner 
seemed 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
whole 
following 
had 
been 
an 
accident

Syme 
was 
UNK 
with 
an 
energy 
that 
was 
something 
between 
bitterness 
and 
a 
burst 
of 
UNK 
derision 
. 
He 
made 
a 
wild 
gesture 
as 
if 
to 
knock 
the 
old 
man 
's 
hat 
off 
, 
called 
out 
something 
like 
`` 
UNK 
me 
if 
you 
can 
, 
'' 
and 
went 
UNK 
away 
across 
the 
white 
, 
open 
UNK 
. 
UNK 
was 
impossible 
now 
; 
and 
looking 
back 
over 
his 
shoulder 
, 
he 
could 
see 
the 
black 
figure 
of 
the 
old 
gentleman 
coming 
after 
him 
with 
long 
, 
swinging 
strides 
like 
a 
man 
winning 
a 
mile 
race 
. 
But 
the 
head 
upon 
that 
bounding 
body 
was 
still 
pale 
, 
grave 
and 
professional 
, 
like 
the 
head 
of 
a 
UNK 
upon 
the 
body 
of 
a 
UNK

got 
leaves

some

in 
his

the

ripe

He 
did

He 
just 
UNK

crept 
out

he

When

heard 
of 
this 
late 
little 
UNK

success 
falling 
to 
his 
unconscious 
rival

the 
last 
link 
snapped 
that 
held 
back 
his 
devilish

Then 
he 
began 
to 
lay 
that 
insane 
siege 
to 
my 
own

has 
been 
the 
talk

in

had 
always 
got 
along

they 
suddenly 
made 
up 
their 
minds 
that 
a 
king 
they 
must 
have

They 
sent 
a 
messenger

they 
had 
the

times 
you

heard

because 
they 
were 
very 
rich 
in 
everything

money

They 
had 
a 
wonderful 
, 
wise 
father

who 
knew 
stories 
to 
tell 
, 
and 
who 
taught 
them 
their 
lessons 
in 
such 
a 
beautiful 
way 
that 
it 
was 
better 
than 
play 
; 
they 
had 
a 
lovely

merry

kind 
mother

who 
was 
never 
too

help

work

watch 
them 
play

they 
had 
all 
the 
great 
green 
country 
to 
play 
in

were 
dark

shadowy 
woods

one 
of

carried 
them 
through

part

morning

was 
, 
that 
Anne 
had 
full 
liberty 
to 
communicate

her

was 
so 
much 
of 
friendliness

of 
flattery

and 
of 
everything 
most 
UNK 
in 
his 
reception 
there 
; 
the 
old 
were 
so 
hospitable 
, 
the 
young 
so 
agreeable

that 
he 
could 
not 
but 
resolve 
to 
remain 
where 
he 
was

take 
all 
the 
charms

little 
longer

they 
were

the

were 
delivered 
into 
their 
hand

all 
that 
were 
with 
them

they 
cried 
to 
God 
in 
the 
battle

he 
was 
intreated

Down 
, 
down 
, 
down 
. 
There 
was 
nothing 
else 
to 
do 
, 
so 
Alice 
soon 
began 
talking 
again 
. 
UNK 
'll 
miss 
me 
very 
much 
to-night 
, 
I 
should 
think 
! 
' 
( 
Dinah 
was 
the 
cat 
. 
) 
'I 
hope 
they 
'll 
remember 
her 
UNK 
of 
milk 
at 
UNK 
. 
Dinah 
my 
dear 
! 
I 
wish 
you 
were 
down 
here 
with 
me 
! 
There 
are 
no 
mice 
in 
the 
air 
, 
I 
'm 
afraid 
, 
but 
you 
might 
catch 
a 
UNK 
, 
and 
that 
's 
very 
like 
a 
mouse 
, 
you 
know 
. 
But 
do 
cats 
eat 
UNK 
, 
I 
wonder 
? 
' 
And 
here 
Alice 
began 
to 
get 
rather 
sleepy 
, 
and 
went 
on 
saying 
to 
herself 
, 
in 
a 
dreamy 
sort 
of 
way 
, 
'Do 
cats 
eat 
UNK 
? 
Do 
cats 
eat 
UNK 
? 
' 
and 
sometimes 
, 
'Do 
UNK 
eat 
cats 
? 
' 
for 
, 
you 
see 
, 
as 
she 
could 
n't 
answer 
either 
question 
, 
it 
did 
n't 
much 
matter 
which 
way 
she 
put 
it 
. 
She 
felt 
that 
she 
was 
UNK 
off 
, 
and 
had 
just 
begun 
to 
dream 
that 
she 
was 
walking 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
Dinah 
, 
and 
saying 
to 
her 
very 
earnestly 
, 
'Now 
, 
Dinah 
, 
tell 
me 
the 
truth 
: 
did 
you 
ever 
eat 
a 
UNK 
? 
' 
when 
suddenly 
, 
thump 
! 
thump 
! 
down 
she 
came 
upon 
a 
heap 
of 
sticks 
and 
dry 
leaves 
, 
and 
the 
fall 
was 
over 
~~ 
~~ 
~ 
~ 
I 
could 
not 
believe 
it. 
-- 
My 
mother 
was 
the 
first 
person 
who 
told 
me 
of 
it 
; 
and 
I 
, 
feeling 
myself 
called 
on 
to 
act 
with 
resolution 
, 
immediately 
said 
to 
her 
, 
'My 
dear 
madam 
, 
I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
you 
may 
intend 
to 
do 
on 
the 
occasion 
, 
but 
as 
for 
myself 
, 
I 
must 
say 
, 
that 
if 
Edward 
does 
marry 
this 
young 
woman 
, 
I 
never 
will 
see 
him 
again 
. 
' 
That 
was 
what 
I 
said 
UNK 
-- 
I 
was 
most 
uncommonly 
shocked 
, 
indeed 
! 
-- 
Poor 
Edward 
! 
-- 
he 
has 
done 
for 
himself 
completely 
-- 
shut 
himself 
out 
for 
ever 
from 
all 
decent 
society 
! 
-- 
but 
, 
as 
I 
directly 
said 
to 
my 
mother 
, 
I 
am 
not 
in 
the 
least 
surprised 
at 
it 
; 
from 
his 
style 
of 
education 
, 
it 
was 
always 
to 
be 
expected

went

came

to 
all

congregation

children

unto 
the 
wilderness

Paran

to 
Kadesh

brought 
back 
word 
unto 
them 
, 
and 
unto 
all 
the 
congregation

shewed 
them 
the 
fruit 
of

land

at

anything

Anne 
, 
very 
much 
preferring 
the 
office 
of 
musician 
to 
a 
more 
active 
post 
, 
played 
country 
dances 
to 
them 
by 
the 
hour 
together 
; 
a 
kindness 
which 
always 
recommended 
her 
musical 
powers 
to 
the 
notice 
of 
Mr 
and 
Mrs 
Musgrove 
more 
than 
anything 
else

often 
drew 
this 
compliment

This

interested 
me 
at 
once

since 
the

had 
ordained 
that 
he 
should 
soon 
become 
my

She 
did 
her

And 
as 
David 
returned 
from 
the 
slaughter 
of 
the 
Philistine

Abner 
took 
him 
,

The 
Chamberlain 
asked 
the 
little 
Nightingale 
to 
come 
and 
sing 
for 
the 
Emperor

The 
little 
Nightingale 
said 
she 
could 
sing 
better 
in 
her 
own 
UNK

she 
was 
so 
sweet

kind

she

For 
all 
this 
his 
anger

not 
turned 
away

his 
hand

Suddenly 
, 
out 
of 
the 
distance 
, 
something 
like 
a 
great 
butterfly 
, 
of 
white 
and 
gold 
, 
swept 
toward 
them

And 
when 
it 
came 
nearer

they 
saw 
that 
it

a

beautiful

UNK

garments

fine

on

a

bright 
that 
no

tell

it 
was 
of

She 
stood

light 
as 
air

on 
a 
great 
, 
shining 
, 
golden 
ball

rolled 
along 
with 
her 
, 
swifter 
than 
the 
wind

ten 
useless

suddenly 
the 
little 
fingers

to 
stir

The 
tiny 
fairies 
who 
were 
hidden 
away 
there 
were 
not 
used 
to 
remaining 
still

they 
were 
getting 
restless

stirred 
so 
that 
Elsa 
jumped 
up 
and 
ran 
to 
the 
cooking 
table

took 
hold 
of 
the 
bread 
board

No 
sooner 
had 
she 
touched 
the 
bread 
board 
than 
the 
little 
fairies 
began 
to 
work

they 
measured 
the 
flour

mixed 
the 
bread

UNK 
the 
loaves

set 
them 
to 
rise

quicker

you 
could 
wink

when 
the 
bread 
was 
done 
, 
it 
was 
as 
nice 
as 
you 
could 
wish

Then 
the 
little 
UNK 
seized 
the 
broom

in 
a

they 
were 
making 
the 
house 
clean

it

all

flew 
about

another

the 
work

exhausted

rather

himself

made

Lucifer

Syme 
in 
his 
turn 
fell 
furiously 
on 
the 
other 
, 
filled 
with 
a 
flaming 
curiosity

The

probably

in

general 
sense

a 
better 
UNK 
than 
he

as 
he 
had 
UNK 
at 
the 
beginning

at 
the 
moment 
the 
Marquis 
seemed 
UNK 
and 
at 
a 
disadvantage

He 
fought 
wildly 
and 
even 
UNK 
, 
and 
he 
constantly 
looked 
away 
at 
the 
railway 
line

almost 
as 
if 
he 
feared 
the 
train 
more 
than 
the 
pointed 
steel

Syme 
, 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
, 
fought 
fiercely 
but 
still 
carefully 
, 
in 
an 
intellectual 
fury 
, 
eager 
to 
UNK 
the 
riddle 
of 
his 
own 
UNK 
sword 
. 
For 
this 
purpose 
, 
he 
aimed 
less 
at 
the 
Marquis 
's 
body 
, 
and 
more 
at 
his 
throat 
and 
head 
. 
A 
minute 
and 
a 
half 
afterwards 
he 
felt 
his 
point 
enter 
the 
man 
's 
neck 
below 
the 
jaw 
. 
It 
came 
out 
clean 
. 
Half 
mad 
, 
he 
thrust 
again 
, 
and 
made 
what 
should 
have 
been 
a 
bloody 
scar 
on 
the 
Marquis 
's 
cheek

But 
there 
was

( 
the

been

Mr

led 
his

Mrs

not

was 
most 
tender

throwing 
any

Anne 
could 
collect 
that 
their

never 
been 
equal

their

of 
living

that 
from 
the 
first

had 
been 
a

general

extravagance

From

she 
could 
discern 
Mr

to 
have 
been 
a

warm

easy 
temper

careless 
habits

not 
strong

much 
more

his

Before

of

they 
were 
visited 
by 
Sir 
John

Mrs. 
Jennings

who 
, 
having 
heard 
of 
the 
arrival 
of 
a 
gentleman 
at 
the 
cottage

came 
to 
take 
a

say

It 
is 
only 
indispensable 
with 
an 
UNK 
running 
whale 
; 
its 
grand 
fact 
and 
feature 
is 
the 
wonderful 
distance 
to 
which 
the 
long 
lance 
is 
UNK 
darted 
from 
a 
violently 
rocking

jerking

And 
when 
he 
was 
come 
to 
the 
king

the 
king 
said 
unto 
him

Micaiah 
, 
shall 
we 
go 
to 
Ramothgilead 
to 
battle

shall 
I

And 
he 
said

One 
spring

delighted

the

she 
said

The

it 
was 
vaguely 
possible

a

young 
lady

have

was 
equally 
at

out

he

he 
had 
had 
no

hearing 
of

from 
herself

her 
letters 
to 
the 
very 
last 
were 
neither 
less 
frequent

nor 
less 
affectionate 
than 
usual

Not

ever 
occurred 
to 
prepare 
him

followed

on 
him 
in 
a 
letter 
from

he 
had 
been 
for 
some

believed

the 
Captain

remained 
unseen 
by 
me 
; 
though 
, 
indeed 
, 
in 
many 
cases 
, 
a 
whale-ship 
will 
be 
completely 
fitted 
out 
, 
and 
receive 
all 
her 
crew 
on 
board 
, 
ere 
the 
captain 
makes 
himself 
visible 
by 
arriving 
to 
take 
command 
; 
for 
sometimes 
these 
voyages 
are 
so 
prolonged 
, 
and 
the 
shore 
intervals 
at 
home 
so 
exceedingly 
brief 
, 
that 
if 
the 
captain 
have 
a 
family 
, 
or 
any 
absorbing 
UNK 
of 
that 
sort 
, 
he 
does 
not 
trouble 
himself 
much 
about 
his 
ship

leaves 
her

After 
a 
time 
, 
Margaret 
had 
a 
chance 
to 
get 
a 
UNK 
, 
and 
then 
she 
became 
a 
UNK 
instead 
of 
a 
UNK 
. 
She 
carried 
the 
bread 
just 
as 
she 
had 
carried 
the 
milk 
, 
in 
her 
cart 
. 
And 
still 
she 
kept 
giving 
money 
to 
the 
asylum 
. 
Then 
the 
great 
war 
came 
, 
the 
UNK 
War 
. 
In 
all 
the 
trouble 
and 
sickness 
and 
fear 
of 
that 
time 
, 
Margaret 
drove 
her 
cart 
of 
bread 
; 
and 
somehow 
she 
had 
always 
enough 
to 
give 
the 
UNK 
soldiers 
, 
and 
for 
her 
babies 
, 
beside 
what 
she 
sold 
. 
And 
despite 
all 
this 
, 
she 
earned 
enough 
so 
that 
when 
the 
war 
was 
over 
she 
built 
a 
big 
steam 
UNK 
for 
her 
bread 
. 
By 
this 
time 
everybody 
in 
the 
city 
knew 
her 
. 
The 
children 
all 
over 
the 
city 
loved 
her 
; 
the 
business 
men 
were 
proud 
of 
her 
; 
the 
poor 
people 
all 
came 
to 
her 
for 
advice 
. 
She 
used 
to 
sit 
at 
the 
open 
door 
of 
her 
office 
, 
in 
a 
UNK 
gown 
and 
a 
little 
shawl 
, 
and 
give 
a 
good 
word 
to 
everybody

or 
poor

from

about

at 
all

for 
Elizabeth 
was 
UNK 
in 
a 
sort 
of 
whisper 
, 
`` 
That 
must 
not 
be 
any 
reason

Right 
at 
the 
end 
sat 
the 
man 
called 
Saturday 
, 
the 
UNK 
and 
the 
most 
baffling 
of 
all 
. 
He 
was 
a 
short 
, 
square 
man 
with 
a 
dark 
, 
square 
face 
clean-shaven 
, 
a 
medical 
UNK 
going 
by 
the 
name 
of 
Bull 
. 
He 
had 
that 
combination 
of 
UNK 
with 
a 
sort 
of 
UNK 
UNK 
which 
is 
not 
uncommon 
in 
young 
doctors 
. 
He 
carried 
his 
fine 
clothes 
with 
confidence 
rather 
than 
ease 
, 
and 
he 
mostly 
wore 
a 
set 
smile 
. 
There 
was 
nothing 
whatever 
odd 
about 
him 
, 
except 
that 
he 
wore 
a 
pair 
of 
dark 
, 
almost 
UNK 
spectacles 
. 
It 
may 
have 
been 
merely 
a 
UNK 
of 
nervous 
fancy 
that 
had 
gone 
before 
, 
but 
those 
black 
UNK 
were 
dreadful 
to 
Syme 
; 
they 
reminded 
him 
of 
UNK 
ugly 
tales 
, 
of 
some 
story 
about 
UNK 
being 
put 
on 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
dead 
. 
Syme 
's 
eye 
always 
caught 
the 
black 
glasses 
and 
the 
blind 
grin 
. 
Had 
the 
dying 
Professor 
worn 
them 
, 
or 
even 
the 
pale 
Secretary 
, 
they 
would 
have 
been 
appropriate 
. 
But 
on 
the 
younger 
and 
UNK 
man 
they 
seemed 
only 
an 
UNK 
. 
They 
took 
away 
the 
key 
of 
the 
face 
. 
You 
could 
not 
tell 
what 
his 
smile 
or 
his 
gravity 
meant 
. 
UNK 
from 
this 
, 
and 
partly 
because 
he 
had 
a 
vulgar 
UNK 
wanting 
in 
most 
of 
the 
others 
it 
seemed 
to 
Syme 
that 
he 
might 
be 
the 
UNK 
of 
all 
those 
wicked 
men 
. 
Syme 
even 
had 
the 
thought 
that 
his 
eyes 
might 
be 
covered 
up 
because 
they 
were 
too 
frightful 
to 
see 
~~ 
~~ 
~ 
~ 
If 
your 
bitterest 
foe 
were 
walking 
straight 
towards 
you 
, 
with 
dagger 
uplifted 
in 
broad 
day 
, 
you 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
see 
him 
, 
any 
more 
than 
if 
he 
were 
stealing 
upon 
you 
from 
behind

that 
found 
them

devoured 
them

their 
adversaries 
said 
, 
We

not

have 
sinned 
against

But 
he 
answered 
one 
of

said 
, 
Friend

Nevertheless

I

In

minutes 
, 
however 
, 
he 
was 
missed 
by 
his 
shipmates

being 
, 
it 
seems 
, 
for 
some 
reason 
a 
huge 
favourite

threw

gave 
a 
snap

The 
poor 
UNK 
had 
listened 
silently 
to 
all 
that 
had 
passed 
, 
and 
felt 
so 
wounded 
, 
that 
at 
last 
he 
wished

never

been 
born

Slowly 
a 
bright 
tear 
fell

the

me

very 
overflowing

mention

much

the 
purpose

that 
on 
quitting 
their

my

One

As

sat 
down 
a 
roar

enthusiasm 
rose

whom

men 
crowned

some 
extraordinary

And 
David

The

night

were 
hardly 
enough 
for 
her 
UNK

She 
was 
bewildered 
amidst 
the 
confusion 
of 
all 
that 
had 
rushed 
on 
her 
within 
the 
last 
few 
hours 
. 
Every 
moment 
had 
brought 
a 
fresh 
surprize 
; 
and 
every 
surprize 
must 
be 
matter 
of 
humiliation 
to 
her.

understand 
it 
all

How

understand 
the 
UNK 
she 
had 
been 
thus 
UNK

herself

!

The 
blunders 
, 
the 
blindness 
of 
her 
own 
head

heart

she 
sat 
still 
, 
she 
walked 
about 
, 
she 
tried 
her 
own 
room 
, 
she 
tried 
the 
UNK

in 
every 
place 
, 
every 
posture 
, 
she 
perceived 
that 
she 
had 
acted 
most 
UNK 
; 
that 
she 
had 
been 
imposed 
on 
by 
others 
in 
a 
most 
UNK 
degree 
; 
that 
she 
had 
been 
imposing 
on 
herself 
in 
a 
degree 
yet 
more 
UNK

that 
she 
was 
wretched
